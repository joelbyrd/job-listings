## My process

### Built with

- <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React (18.3)</a> - JS library  
  React is a solid tool for building frontend apps -- it's modern, mature, and powerful. With components, reducers, and state, it lets you create scalable UIs that don't fall apart the moment someone clicks something weird.

- <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> - Strongly-typed JavaScript  
  TypeScript is like JavaScript with a safety net. Because it is strongly-typed JavaScript, it makes sure you don't accidentally pass a banana where the code expects a car. No more guessing what your data should look like -- TypeScript keeps it clean and sane.

- <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> - For styles  
  Tailwind CSS is a developer's best friend when it comes to styling. It's like playing with LEGO bricks -- quick to build and easy to customize. Plus, it pairs beautifully with a component-based architecture like React, making styling reusable and predictable.

- <a href="https://vite.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a> - Frontend build tool  
  Vite is like Webpack's cool younger sibling -- super fast and doesn't need a ton of babysitting. It gets out of your way, so you can focus on building instead of waiting for the dev server to restart.

- <a href="https://vitest.dev/" target="_blank">Vitest</a> - Testing framework  
  Vitest is Jest, but with a caffeine boost. Since I was already using Vite, Vitest was a no-brainer -- same familiar syntax, faster performance, and no “config rage.” It's simple, fast, and doesn't make testing feel like a chore.

- **Mobile-first design**  
  The app is designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure it looks great and works smoothly on all devices. It includes a sticky filter bar, making it easy to filter job listings as you scroll.

- **Light/Dark modes**  
  I implemented light and dark modes to enhance accessibility and user experience. It defaults to the user's system settings, respecting their preferences for brightness and contrast.
